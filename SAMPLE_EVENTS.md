## Tips for Creating Your Own

### Keep It Age-Appropriate
- **Ages 3-5**: 3-5 tasks max, 5-10 min each
- **Ages 6-8**: 5-8 tasks, 5-15 min each
- **Ages 9-12**: 8-12 tasks, varying times
- **Teens**: Flexible task counts, focus on responsibility

### Start Small
Begin with 3-4 essential tasks and add more as the routine becomes established.

### Be Realistic
Set duration times based on your child's actual pace, not your ideal pace.

### Make It Visual
Images make a huge difference! Kids respond much better to visual cues.

### Include Breaks
For longer routines, add "free time" or "rest" tasks between activities.

### Celebrate Success
Use the integration's announcement features to celebrate when tasks are done!
